#### 关于updateAcquireFence: Did not find frame.
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/104268
The message updateAcquireFence: Did not find frame. isn't something to be worried about.
The Android team told us that this is likely a bug in HWUI and doesn't signal an error.

For the time being we should consider filtering this out from flutter run output since I agree it can be a lot of spam.
